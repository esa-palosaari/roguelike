  * Robots -- `RobotBody` objects -- can be added to the robot world, and the robot 
  * world object maintains a robot listing which allows robots to take their turns 
  * in a round-robin fashion. Apart from robots, a robot world can also contain walls,
  * and indeed is bounded by walls on all sides: all the edge squares of
  * all robot worlds are always unpassable by robots.  
  *
  * @param floorWidth   the width of the robot world, in squares, ''in addition to the walls on both sides''. The total width of the grid will be two plus this number.
  * @param floorHeight  the height of the robot world, in squares, ''in addition to the walls at the top and at the bottom''. The total height of the grid will be two plus this number.
