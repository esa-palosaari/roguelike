Ohjelmointistudio 1:n miniprojekti, roguelike-peli.

FlappyWorld.scala in the flappy package has the start place.

The idea of the game is to try to get the hero to next levels by moving it 
around with arrow or num pad keys. When the hero gets to the stairs (a Gray 
rectangle), the player can move it to the next level by pressing spacebar.

There are also monsters lurking around. When they notice the hero they will
start following it and try to kill it. When the hero's health (the green bar
on a top of the window) has gone down to zero, the game ends. The hero can 
also attack and kill the monsters if he has health points left.
